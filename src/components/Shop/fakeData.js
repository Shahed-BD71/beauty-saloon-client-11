      "Ask anyone who knows me—I loooove a good lip gloss. I’ll wear it alone or throw it on over a lipstick to add some sheen, and this lip gloss from Tarte is one of the best I’ve tried all year. It doesn’t even feel like you’re wearing lip gloss. It’s lightweight, hydrating (thanks, vitamin E), and because of the vanilla in the formula, this makeup product smells good enough to eat (pls don’t do that, though).",
